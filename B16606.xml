            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Account of the many Frauds and Abuses, which have been frequently Committed in the late War with <hi>France,</hi> and still are continued to the great prejudice, and discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sea-men.</head>
            <p>AS it must be acknowledged that the Trade, Honour and Safety of the Nation do very much depend on the number of Ships belonging to it, so it cannot be denied but all due care and encouragement ought to be taken of, and given to Sea-men, whose use and Service is so very great and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
            <p>How much then is their Case to be pitied and considered, that whilst they are exposing themselves to diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and dangers in the defence and service of their Country, advantage should be taken of their absence, and Impositions on their weakness, and unwariness, and all occasions improved to wrong them of, and to lessen and take from their Wages, which, together with other hardships put upon them, too often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens: Instances of which, in order to a redress thereof, are now particularly and humbly set forth.</p>
            <p>First, That many persons have pretended, and still do pretend to be serviceable to Sea-men in receiving their Wages, which the poor Sea-men believing, and not having time or liberty to look after the same themselves, impower the said persons to receive their Wages, which when received, the persons impower'd as aforesaid often abscond, and cheat them of their said Wages.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That others, instead of taking Letters of Attorney from Sea-men to receive their Wages, have caused Bills of Sale to be made of the same, which when paid, the persons to whom such Bills of Sale have been made pretend a right to the said Wages.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That oftentimes the hands of Sea-men are Counterfeited, and forged when at home, as well as at Sea and a great distance off, and their Wages received under such pretended power and authority.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That several persons, under pretence of receiving Sea-mens Wages at an under rate, and short of what is usual, have kept back several small summs of Money, under pretence of deductions made in the Kings Books.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That others, when Tickets have been sold at a very low and under rate, by poor Sea-men, have taken Bonds from such Sea-men for the payment of so much Money at a certain day, or at the payment of their Wages by the King, and have put the same in suit, and recovered thereupon, pretending they never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any such Money, and sometimes that the Bonds were absolute, and had no reference to the assignment of the Tickets or Wages, altho the said Bonds were given only as a Collateral security.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That Letters of Attorney, Assignments, or Bills of Sale of Seamens Wages have been often antida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the persons to whom the same have been made, have received the Wages upon such antidated power, and so deceived others, who have had an honest right to their Wages by Assignments lawfully executed.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That oftentimes when but a small matter is due to their Landlords and Landladies, Seamen, at their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Sea, are prevailed on to make them a Letter of Attorney, and Bill of Sale of their whole Wages, (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead only of giving a Letter of Attorney and a Bond for their Debt, which is usual) when not so much as a quarter part of the said Wages is due to them; which Wages, when received, the said Landlords and Landladies detain to their own use, without accounting for the same to the said Seamen, their poor Families or Relations.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That Seamen at their going to Sea, are frequently prevailed on to make their Wills, and to give all their whole Wages to their Landlords and Landladies, altho the said Seamen have Wives, Children, and other poor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ive.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That several Persons, Servants, and Apprentices to Masters of Ships, Watermen, and Tradesmen, upon Credit of their Wages, are supply'd with Dyet, Cloaths, and other necessaries, often to the full amount of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
